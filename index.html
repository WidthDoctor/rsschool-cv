        <span>Hi, my name is Anton Popov!
          I now live in Krakow (that's Poland if anything, KURWA BOBER all things you know)<br>
          I started to learn html and css back in 2020, or maybe even earlier, I do not remember. I definitely learned about the school in 2020 and immediately went from scratch to STAGE 1. It was difficult, I got to an interview with a mentor and then I had to stop learning because of problems. After that I studied on my own solving level 8 problems with CODEWARS and after a while I went back to studying because I couldn't do without programming at all. I came back in 2022 for Stage 0 and got my certificate =) It was easy for me because I had some experience in page design and it was just a consolidation of what I had learned and then I went to stage 1 and I finished that pretty well too! I learned a lot in Stage 2 but unfortunately I was silly enough to send a mate too much of my code and was banned for "copying" it, although I did it all myself but that's ok. I now have the experience that I have to help other guys right too. It is very frustrating that a lot of tasks will have to do over again, but it is a very good opportunity to polish your code without doing everything from scratch. Hopefully it won't be the third time I have to layout Shelter ahahha.</span>
