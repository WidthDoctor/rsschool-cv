                    <h3 id="Title_middle">I did a lot of things: I was a guitar teacher in a music school, and when it began to get bored I tried my hand at door and furniture restoration. I had incredible success and now my wife and I moved to Poland, where I worked as an assistant arborist and now I work as a carwash worker.

                        Before that I was already on the RS School course in 2020 and reached the interview with the mentor, but unfortunately my life changed drastically and there were big changes and I was not able to continue my studies. I never lost interest in this occupation and continued to study on my own when I had time.

                        <p>
                            I really hope nothing happens anytime soon and I can do what I really enjoy!

                                    Much of what was in the design did not work. (The design was made by my wife :* )
