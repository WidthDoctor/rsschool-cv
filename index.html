              i did a lot of things: i was a guitar teacher in a music school,
              and when it began to get bored i tried my hand at door and
              furniture restoration. i had incredible success and now my wife
              and i moved to poland, then i did all the basic things for a
              beginner tester of the "upskill me" course from epam. i didn't
              start taking the internal exams because there was an english test
              that required a b2. i finished that without passing the
              exams(java,java-script, pithon,c++), but i passed the english test
              at a2+ and then i got a job as an assistant arborist and now i
              work as a carwash worker. before that i was already on the ts
              school course in 2020 and reached the interview with the mentor,
              but unfortunately my life changed drastically and there were big
              changes and i was not able to continue my studies. i never lost
              interest in this occupation and continued to study on my own when
              i had time.<br>

              I really hope nothing happens anytime soon and I can do what I
              really enjoy!

                    at the request of a colleague it was necessary to make a

                    is used to work. much of what was in the design did not
                    work. (the design was made by my wife :* ) old site
