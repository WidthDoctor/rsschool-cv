                    <h3 id="Title_middle">i did a lot of things: i was a guitar teacher in a music school, and when it began to get bored i tried my hand at door and furniture restoration. i had incredible success and now my wife and i moved to poland, then i did all the basic things for a beginner tester of the "upskill me" course from epam. i didn't start taking the internal exams because there was an english test that required a b2. i finished that without passing the exams(java,java-script, pithon,c++), but i passed the english test at a2+ and then i got a job as an assistant arborist and now i work as a carwash worker.
                        before that i was already on the ts school course in 2020 and reached the interview with the mentor, but unfortunately my life changed drastically and there were big changes and i was not able to continue my studies. i never lost interest in this occupation and continued to study on my own when i had time.<br>

                        I really hope nothing happens anytime soon and I can do what I really enjoy!
