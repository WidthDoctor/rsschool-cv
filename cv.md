## <span style="color:#66b2ff">About Myself</span>

I did a lot of things: I was a guitar teacher in a music school, and when it began to get bored I tried my hand at door and furniture restoration. I had incredible success and now my wife and I moved to Poland, where I worked as an assistant arborist and now I work as a carwash worker.

Before that I was already on the RS School course in 2020 and reached the interview with the mentor, but unfortunately my life changed drastically and there were big changes and I was not able to continue my studies. I never lost interest in this occupation and continued to study on my own when I had time.

I realy hope nothing happens anytime soon and I can do what I really enjoy!

UPD: I almost at the very end of the school I helped someone with a problem, becaause of whitch my code was copied and a was expelled from the school =C

My solution is:

```
const convert = (input, source, target) => {
  let decimalValue = input.split('').reduce((acc, cur, i) => {
    return acc + (source.indexOf(cur) * (source.length ** (input.length - 1 - i)));
  }, 0);

  let result = [];
  let value = 0;

  do {
    value = decimalValue % target.length;
    decimalValue = Math.floor(decimalValue / target.length);
    result.push(target[value]);
  }
  while (decimalValue > 0);

  return result.reverse().join('');
};


var Alphabet = {
  BINARY: '01',
  OCTAL: '01234567',
  DECIMAL: '0123456789',
  HEXA_DECIMAL: '0123456789abcdef',
  ALPHA_LOWER: 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz',
  ALPHA_UPPER: 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ',
  ALPHA: 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ',
  ALPHA_NUMERIC: '0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
};
let bin = Alphabet.BINARY, oct = Alphabet.OCTAL, dec = Alphabet.DECIMAL, hex = Alphabet.HEXA_DECIMAL,
  allow = Alphabet.ALPHA_LOWER, alup = Alphabet.ALPHA_UPPER, alpha = Alphabet.ALPHA, alnum = Alphabet.ALPHA_NUMERIC;
